# Image downloader extension 🖼

It is a extension to download images from any web site, so if you have any
idea, feature, fix or anything to improve it, feel free to fork it.

[Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/global-image-downloader/idfidomcjfggfmmdgcjikdpdkoejdcml?hl=es&authuser=0)

### [How to run it?](#how-to-run-it)

- Install the dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start`
- It will generate a dist folder, so you have to go to
  `chrome -> extensions -> active developer mode` and then
  click on `upload extension without package`, so you select the
  `dist` folder

### Do you want collaborate? 👏🏼

We are open to improve the code, features, design or anything that you think, so:

- Fork the repo
- Create a cool feature
- Send the pull request (I think that we need a guide to create the new feature 😅)
